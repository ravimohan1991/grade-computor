Grade Computor
==============

> [v1.0]

Grade Computor is a handy utility to judge the relative grades of the class of students.  It provides a powerful interface to adjust grade cutoffs and display the quantitative information in a visually appealing manner.  This utility was designed for PHY102M course taught in University of Texas at Austin but is flexible enough to serve any other Universityâ€™s requirements.

REQUIREMENTS
==================================================================================================

Recommended
-------------------
* Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 1.8.0_191-b12 (or above).
* Any Operating System with the capability to run above JRE.




INSTALLATION
==================================================================================================

Assumption - I assume that you have compiled my code.  Refer Coding and
Compiling section if you have not compiled it yet.  If you are lazy or ignorant enough, I am providing the compiled executable code in the directory dist/.  Just copy the entire directory on the local machine and run gradeComputor.jar (yeah double click work!).


USAGE
========
It is quite simple to use the Grade Computor.  If you need any help, open up the issue in this repository.

Coding and Compiling
======================
Download the latest JAVA IDE (or any of your favorite editor) NetBeans from [here] (https://netbeans.org).  Clone this repository on the local machine and add the project gradeComputor by traversing to the appropriate directory.  Hit on "Clean and Build Project".  That is it.  In future I might add the appropriate Maven support.


THANKS
==================================================================================================

* All my students for their constant pestering and nagging about the computation of the grades based on relative curving!  No worries, we got something nice out of it.
