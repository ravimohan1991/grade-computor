Grade Computor
==============

> [v1.0]

Grade Computor is a handy utility to judge the relative grades of the class of students.  It provides a powerful interface to adjust grade cutoffs and display the quantitative information in a visually appealing manner.  This utility was designed for PHY102M course taught in University of Texas at Austin but is flexible enough to serve any other Universityâ€™s requirements.

REQUIREMENTS
==================================================================================================

Recommended
-------------------
* Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 1.8.0_191-b12 (or above).
* Any Operating System with the capability to run above JRE.




INSTALLATION
==================================================================================================

Assumption - I assume that you have compiled my code and have ACEManager(version).u/.int files. Refer Coding and
Compiling section (in ReadMe.pdf) if you have not compiled it yet.

Server Install:
---------------

* Move ACEManager(version).u/.int contents to your System folder.
* Open UnrealTournament.ini
* Scroll to [Engine.GameEngine] section. Be sure to add ACEManager ServerActor before ACE ServerActor.
 Also make sure that it is added after IpToCountry and Nexgen ServerActors. So you should have something
 like this
 
        [Engine.GameEngine]
        ServerActors=ipToCountry.LinkActor
        ServerActors=Nexgen(version).NexgenActor
        ServerPackages=ACEManager(version)
        ServerActors=ACEManager(version).ACEM_Actor
        ServerActors=NPLoader_v16b.NPLActor
        ServerActors=ACEv08g_S.ACEActor
        ServerActors=ACEv08g_EH.ACEEventActor


Client Install
---------------

* Move ACEManager(version).u and ACEManager(version).int to your System folder.




USAGE
========

Server install:
------------------

If it is installed in server then -:

Open the ACEManager GUI in-game, by typing "mutate ace manage".
You can use the following features of ACEManager through that GUI.

* Configure ACE

Available to all players. Basically does mutate blah blah for client-side settings.
Working of each button has been explained in GUI.


* SShot

The most admirable part of the Manager, available to all players, is this page. There is no need to
know the ID of players and no need to remember those long commands. ACE snap of the players is just a click away!


* Ban Manager

The most attractive and useful feature of ACEManager. This page can be accessed by the admins only, where they
can manage bans. ACEManager identifies 3 kind of admins

a)Root Admin (of the server)
b)Nexgen_Ban_Oprator (you know who)
c)ACEManager Admin (the guy knowing the ACEPass) - The right of ACEManager Admin is to manage bans and
take snaps only.


Client install:
-----------------

Open GUI in-game through the mod menu.
Advantage??

If you join a server which doesn't have ACEManager. You can still use Configure ACE and SShot (if you know the
password) facility with this install.

Note : ACEManager, when opened through mod-menu, will not show Ban page.




CONFIGURING ACEManager
==================================================================================================

Following variables can be found in ACEManager.ini

CheckBanType:
--------------
* 0 = only HwID check
* 1 = HwID+ACEMacHash check
* 2 = HwID+ACEMacHash+UTDCMacHash check


bAllowAnyonetoSnap:
--------------------
If set true, everyone is allowed to take snap. If set to false only admin (see the definition in
Ban Manager section) and players knowing password of ACE can take snap.

ACEPass:
---------
Set it to some word if you want to appoint someone as ACEManager Admin.
Note:This password is a variable of ACEManager and is used by ACEManager only.

bDebug:
--------
set it true so that it can log the events of ACEManager
(As a beta tester, you should always set it true)

CountryFlagsPackage:
----------------------
The package for CountryFlags you want to display.
If you are a ServerAdmin then you can jump directly to FAQ section. Don't forget to see the ChangeLog file.
