Grade Computor
==============

> [v1.0]

Grade Computor is a handy utility to judge the relative grades of the class of students.  It provides a powerful interface to adjust grade cutoffs and display the quantitative information in a visually appealing manner.  This utility was designed for PHY102M course taught in University of Texas at Austin but is flexible enough to serve any other Universityâ€™s requirements.

Assumption - I assume that you have compiled my code.  Refer Coding and
Compiling section if you have not compiled it yet.  If you are lazy or ignorant enough, I am providing the compiled executable code in the directory dist/.  Just copy the entire directory on the local machine and run gradeComputor.jar (yeah double click work!).


USAGE
========
It is quite simple to use the Grade Computor.  If you need any help, open up the issue in this repository.


THANKS
==================================================================================================

* All my students for their constant pestering and nagging about the computation of the grades based on relative curving!  No worries, we got something nice out of it.
